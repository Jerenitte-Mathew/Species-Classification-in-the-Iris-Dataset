# Species-Classification-in-the-Iris-Dataset
Machine Learning classification algorithms to classify species in the famous Iris dataset!

🔍 Project Highlights:

✅ Data Loading & Exploration: Understanding dataset structure, handling missing values

✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Univariate & bivariate analysis, visualizing distributions

✅ Feature Engineering: Transforming data for better model performance

✅ Data Visualizations: Using Matplotlib & Seaborn for insights

✅ Model Building: Training classification models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)

✅ Model Evaluation: Performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

This project strengthened my hands-on experience in ML pipelines, feature selection, and performance evaluation. Looking forward to diving deeper into more complex datasets! 🚀
